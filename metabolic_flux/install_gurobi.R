##Using Gurobi with RStudio
#1. Register a Gurobi account as an academic user at https://pages.gurobi.com/registration . Please register as a student using your university email address and donâ€™t lose the password.
#2. Go to https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer-eula/ , read and accept the End User License Agreement. Then download the current version of Gurobi optimizer. 
# Install the optimizer with default settings.
#3. Request for a license at  https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/, enter User Portal, and you will obtain a Gurobi key. 
# Copy and paste the Gurobi key to the terminal: $grbgetkey xxxxxx
#4. Run the following R command in RStudio:
install.packages('/Library/gurobi1002/macos_universal2/R/gurobi_10.0-2_R_4.2.0.tgz', repos=NULL)
#5. Now you should be able to solve linear programming problem with Gurobi in RStudio. Try running the following piece of code:
  
# This example formulates and solves the following simple LP model:
#  maximize
#        x + 2 y + 3 z
#  subject to
#        x +   y <= 1
#        y +   z <= 1
